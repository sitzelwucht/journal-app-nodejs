## Use

This is a node.js app where the user creates an account and can then perform various actions after logging in: read and write entries, give them tags, search for entries including a given string. Authentication with Passport takes place before displaying any account-specific information.

## Installation

The project uses MongoDB and mongoose for the database and Passport for logging in. Additionally, for rendering the views ejs is used.
